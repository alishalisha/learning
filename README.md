#This is my first Github repo!

It's where I'll place information on what I'm currently teaching myself,
along with any resources that I'm using - like books or articles.

I hope you'll find it helpful, too. Shoot me an email at [ramos.alisha@gmail.com](mailto:ramos.alisha@gmail.com) if you have any questions.
