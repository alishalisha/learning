					<h3>About</h3>
					<p>Thanks for visiting! This site was made by me, Alisha Ramos. I'm a freelance product designer. I taught myself HTML and CSS when I was ten years old, in 1999 through a website called Funky Chickens. During college, I didn't study design but Sociology and History instead. After graduating, I had a brief stint as a brand strategy consultant, but my true passion for web design was calling me, so I left that job in August 2013 to embark a new journey as a freelance designer.</p>
					<p>As I'm freelancing, I also want to improve my skills and learn new ones. That's how this study guide came about! It includes resources and tools I've used on topics I'm interested in learning. It's not an exhaustive list of all the great resources out there - only the ones I've actually used and put into practice.</p>
					<p>Please feel free to <a href="http://github.com/alishalisha/learning">fork this on GitHub</a> and make your own study guide! If you'd like to chat or say hello, you can reach me at <a href="mailto:ramos.alisha@gmail.com">ramos.alisha@gmail.com</a> or tweet me <a href="http://twitter.com/alishalisha">@alishalisha</a>. Cheers!</p>
